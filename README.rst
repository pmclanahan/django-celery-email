A `Django`_ email backend that uses a `Celery`_ queue for out-of-band sending
of the messages.

.. _`Celery`: http://celeryproject.org/
.. _`Django`: http://www.djangoproject.org/

.. warning::

	This version requres the following minimum versions:

	* Python 2.7 and Python >= 3.3
	* Django >= 1.7
	* Celery 2.4

Using django-celery-email
=========================

To enable ``django-celery-email`` for your project you need to add ``djcelery_email`` to
``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    INSTALLED_APPS += ("djcelery_email",)

You must then set ``django-celery-email`` as your ``EMAIL_BACKEND``::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'djcelery_email.backends.CeleryEmailBackend'

By default ``django-celery-email`` will use Django's builtin ``SMTP`` email backend
for the actual sending of the mail. If you'd like to use another backend, you
may set it in ``CELERY_EMAIL_BACKEND`` just like you would normally have set
``EMAIL_BACKEND`` before you were using Celery. In fact, the normal installation
procedure will most likely be to get your email working using only Django, then
change ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` to ``CELERY_EMAIL_BACKEND``, and then add the new
``EMAIL_BACKEND`` setting from above.

Mass email are sent in chunks of size ``CELERY_EMAIL_CHUNK_SIZE`` (defaults to 10).

If you need to set any of the settings (attributes) you'd normally be able to set on a
`Celery Task`_ class had you written it yourself, you may specify them in a ``dict``
in the ``CELERY_EMAIL_TASK_CONFIG`` setting::

    CELERY_EMAIL_TASK_CONFIG = {
        'queue' : 'email',
        'rate_limit' : '50/m',  # * CELERY_EMAIL_CHUNK_SIZE (default: 10)
        ...
    }

There are some default settings. Unless you specify otherwise, the equivalent of the
following settings will apply::

    CELERY_EMAIL_TASK_CONFIG = {
        'name': 'djcelery_email_send',
        'ignore_result': True,
    }

After this setup is complete, and you have a working Celery install, sending
email will work exactly like it did before, except that the sending will be
handled by your Celery workers::

    from django.core import mail

    emails = (
        ('Hey Man', "I'm The Dude! So that's what you call me.", 'dude@aol.com', ['mr@lebowski.com']),
        ('Dammit Walter', "Let's go bowlin'.", 'dude@aol.com', ['wsobchak@vfw.org']),
    )
    results = mail.send_mass_mail(emails)

``results`` will be a list of celery `AsyncResult`_ objects that you may ignore, or use to check the
status of the email delivery task, or even wait for it to complete if want. You have to enable a result
backend and set ``ignore_result`` to ``False`` in ``CELERY_EMAIL_TASK_CONFIG`` if you want to use these.
See the `Celery docs`_ for more info.

``len(results)`` will be the number of emails you attempted to send, and is in no way a reflection on the success or failure 
of their delivery.
